Data in this repo:
- Data from pull and release experiments for trees in Wytham Woods
- Summary data on the fundamental frequencies of trees derived from field data
- Summary data on the fundamental frequencies of trees and dominance of the fundamental mode derived from finite element simulations
- Architectural indices derived from TLS data for > 1000 trees 

Scripts in this repo:
- Overview_Fig3_5 - Summarize and plot field data and model outputs
- Architecture_PCA - Plot covariance matrix and principal component analysis for tree architecture indices
- f0_LMs and D0_LMs calculate linear models used in the paper (Table 1)
