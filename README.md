Data in the repo:
1. Data from pull and release experiments for trees in Wytham Woods
2. Summary data on the fundamental frequencies of trees derived from field data
3. Summary data on the fundamental frequencies of trees and dominance of the fundamental mode derived from finite element simulations
4. Architectural indices derived from TLS data for > 1000 trees 

Scripts in this repo:
1. Overview_Fig3_5 - Summarize and plot field data and model outputs
2. Architecture_PCA - Plot covariance matrix and principal component analysis for tree architecture indices
3. f0_LMs and D0_LMs calculate linear models used in the paper (Table 1)
